# Boop - Development Tasks
The game by Scott Brady

## Overview
Create a digital version of "Boop" by Scott Brady - a strategic board game where players place kittens and cats on a bed to form lines of three while "booping" (pushing) opponent pieces.

## Core Game Components

### 1. Game Board Setup
- Create a 6x6 grid representing the bed/quilt
- Design visual representation of the bed with quilt pattern
- Implement coordinate system for board positions
- Add visual indicators for empty spaces vs occupied spaces

### 2. Game Pieces
- Design two colors of kitten pieces (8 each per player)
- Design two colors of cat pieces (8 each per player)
- Create visual distinction between kittens and cats
- Implement piece animations for placement and movement

### 3. Player Management
- Set up two-player game structure
- Track each player's available pieces (kittens in play, cats in reserve)
- Implement turn-based gameplay
- Add player color selection system

## Core Game Logic

### 4. Piece Placement System
- Allow placement of kittens/cats on empty board spaces
- Validate legal moves
- Track piece ownership and type on each board position
- Handle piece selection from available inventory

### 5. Line Detection & Graduation
- Detect horizontal, vertical, and diagonal lines of 3 pieces
- Implement kitten graduation to cats when forming lines
- Handle mixed lines (kittens + cats of same color)
- Manage removal of graduated pieces from board
- Add graduated cats to player's available pieces

### 6. Boop Mechanics
- Implement adjacency detection for newly placed pieces
- Calculate boop directions and targets
- Handle kitten booping rules (kittens only)
- Handle cat booping rules (both kittens and cats)
- Implement "group immunity" (pieces in a row cannot be booped)
- Handle pieces being booped off the board edge

### 7. Boop Chain Resolution
- Process all boop effects from a single placement
- Prevent booped pieces from causing additional boops
- Handle cases where booping creates new lines of 3
- Resolve multiple simultaneous line formations

### 8. Win Conditions
- Detect three cats in a row (primary win condition)
- Detect all 8 cats on board at end of turn (alternate win condition)
- Display win/loss states

## Advanced Game Rules

### 9. Board Overflow Management
- Detect when player has all 8 pieces on board at start of turn
- Implement forced piece removal
- Handle graduation of removed kittens vs saving removed cats

### 10. Edge Case Handling
- Manage overlapping lines of 3+ pieces
- Allow player choice when multiple valid lines exist
- Handle simultaneous line creation by both players
- Validate impossible game states

## User Interface

### 11. Visual Design
- Create appealing kitten and cat artwork
- Design intuitive board layout with clear grid
- Implement hover effects for valid moves
- Add visual feedback for booping animations

### 12. Game Controls
- Click/tap to select pieces from inventory
- Click/tap to place pieces on board
- Highlight available moves and valid placements
- Add undo/redo functionality for accidental moves

### 13. Game State Display
- Show current player turn
- Display each player's available pieces
- Show score/progress indicators
- Add move history log

### 14. Animations & Effects
- Animate piece placement
- Create smooth booping animations with directional movement
- Add particle effects for graduation events
- Include audio feedback for key actions

## Technical Implementation

### 15. Data Structures
- Board state representation (6x6 grid)
- Player state tracking (available pieces, color)
- Move validation system
- Game history for undo functionality

### 16. Game Engine
- Turn management system
- Move processing pipeline
- Rule validation engine
- State transition management

### 17. AI Opponent (Optional)
- Implement basic AI for single-player mode
- Add difficulty levels
- Create strategic evaluation functions
- Implement minimax or similar algorithm

## Testing & Polish

### 18. Game Testing
- Test all rule combinations and edge cases
- Verify win conditions work correctly
- Test booping mechanics with various configurations
- Validate graduation and piece management

### 19. User Experience
- Add tutorial/onboarding for new players
- Implement game settings and preferences
- Create help system with rule explanations
- Add accessibility features (colorblind support, etc.)

### 20. Performance & Optimization
- Optimize board rendering and animations
- Implement efficient move calculation
- Add game state serialization for save/load
- Test performance with complex board states

## Deployment & Distribution

### 21. Platform Considerations
- Web-based implementation for accessibility
- Mobile-responsive design
- Cross-browser compatibility testing
- Optional native mobile app development

### 22. Multiplayer Features (Advanced)
- Online multiplayer support
- Matchmaking system
- Game lobby and spectator mode
- Friend invitation system

## Additional Features

### 23. Customization Options
- Multiple visual themes
- Custom piece designs
- Board size variants (if desired)
- House rule toggles

### 24. Analytics & Metrics
- Track game statistics
- Monitor player engagement
- Collect feedback for improvements
- Performance monitoring

This comprehensive task list covers all aspects of implementing the Boop board game digitally, from core mechanics to advanced features and polish.
